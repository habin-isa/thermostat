Thermosturt
----------

One week task with changed pairing, we created a simulation of a thermostat using JavaScript where the temperature can be changed using an interactive UI. We had a lot of fun during this challenge, and created an interactive cyber cube interface.

Features include:

- The temperature can be turned up and down
- The temperature is displayed
- Power saving mode can be turned on and off, capping the maximum temperature accordingly
- Weather API shows you the weather in other cities
